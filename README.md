<h1><i>How to eat ice Cream: For Beginners and People who Refuse to eat ice cream Correctly</i></h1>
<h2>Imagine this. You're eating ice cream with friends, and you see one of your friends bite off the entire top of the cone. Immediatly you feel a cringe inside of you. This guide will help those people, who just don't know how to eat ice cream.</h2>
<p></p>
<li><b></b>Step one of many</b>: NEVER use your teeth to bite the ice cream. You may use your teeth to eat the cone, but DO NOT use the teeth to bite ice cream.</li>
<p></p>
<li> Two: Never ever ever eat the entire cone in one bite. That is gross and weird and your mouth would be huge.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Three: Do not break the cone and eat the ice cream like a cupcake or sandwich.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Four: DO NOT BREAK THE BOTTOM OF THE CONE!!</li>
<p></p>
<li>Five: GRAPE WILL NEVER BE AN ICE CREAM FLAVOR!!</li>
<p></p>
<li>Six: Never eat your ice cream upside down. You are not Harry Potter and your ice cream will fall. You will be sad.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Seven: Even if you are in a relationship, sharing an ice cream cone is never okay. It's gross.</li>
<h3> Now that you know what not to do, let's discuss what to do.</h3>
<p></p>
<li> One: Make sure you are only ever using your tongue to lick the sides of the ice cream to make sure nothing drips.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Two: If you ever need to use your teeth at all, wrap your lips around them to protect your teeth. It doesn't matter if you have a moustache, you can always lick it off.'</li>
<p></p>
<li>Three: Eating your ice cream in a bowl will only be allowed when your a four year old or if you are in a hurry.</li>
<p></p>
<h4>This is all the information that I can gift to you. If you can bite into ice cream without your teeth being bothered, then you are a superhuman and a monster and cannot be helped. I hope this can help even the most troubled souls, but if not, I apologize sincerely.
